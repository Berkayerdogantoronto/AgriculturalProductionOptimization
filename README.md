# Agricultural Production Optimization
 This project is intended for Precision Farming. We will maximize productivity by understanding crop requirements for climatic and soil conditions. It will help us deal with the unpredictability of the weather. 
# Problem Statement
 We will build a predictive model so as to suggest the most suitable "crops" to grow based on the available climatic and soil conditions. 
 Let's say there is a farmer Berkay in Toronto who only grows rice during the rainy season and keeps his land empty during the rest of the seasons now we can recommend some alternative crops to him that can
 be grown in that soil and weather conditions for other seasons such as summer and winter then it can help Berkay to properly utilize his land.
