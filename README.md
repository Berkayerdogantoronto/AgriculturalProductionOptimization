# AgriculturalProductionOptimization
 This project is intended for Precision Farming. We will optimize productivity by understanding the requirements of climatic and soil conditions for crops. It will help us to cope up with weather unpredictability. 
# Problem Statment
 We will build a predictive model so as to suggest the most suitable "crops" to grow based on the available climatic and soil conditions.
