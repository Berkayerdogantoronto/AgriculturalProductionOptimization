# Advanced Techniques for Optimization of Agricultural Production
 This project, led by farmer Berkay, is dedicated to Precision Farming. He uses agricultural data to optimize agricultural productivity by understanding the specific needs of crops in varying weather and soil conditions. This approach helps Berkay and other farmers adapt to unpredictable weather, ensuring better crop yields.
## Business Impacts
* By recommending alternative crops that are better suited for different seasons and conditions, farmers like Berkay can maximize their crop yield and overall agricultural productivity. This can lead to higher crop yields per unit of land and, consequently, increased revenue.
* Berkay can make more efficient use of his land and resources, such as water and fertilizer. This can lead to cost savings and reduced resource wastage, contributing to a more sustainable and environmentally friendly approach to farming.
* The project can identify new market opportunities for Berkay. By suggesting alternative crops, it can open doors to new markets and demand for different agricultural products, potentially leading to increased revenue streams.
* By optimizing resource usage and reducing the need for chemical inputs through crop diversification, the project can have a positive environmental impact, contributing to sustainable agriculture practices.
* The knowledge and insights gained from the project can be shared within Berkay's family, leading to a collective improvement in agricultural practices and outcomes for future generations.



## Problem Statement
 We will build a predictive model so as to suggest the most suitable "crops" to grow based on the available climatic and soil conditions. 
 Let's say there is a farmer Berkay in Toronto who only grows rice during the rainy season and keeps his land empty during the rest of the seasons now we can recommend some alternative crops to him that can
 be grown in that soil and weather conditions for other seasons such as summer and winter then it can help Berkay to properly utilize his land.
